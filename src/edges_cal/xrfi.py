    Notes
    -----
    This function can typically be used to implement a flagged median filter. It does
    have some limitations in this regard, which we will now describe.

    It would be expected that a perfectly smooth
    monotonic function, after median filtering, should remain identical to the input.
    This is only the case for the default 'nearest' mode. For the alternative 'reflect'
    mode, the edge-data will be corrupted from the input. On the other hand, it may be
    expected that if the kernel width is equal to or larger than the data size, that
    the operation is merely to perform a full collapse over that dimension. This is the
    case only for mode 'reflect', while again mode 'nearest' will continue to yield (a
    very slow) identity operation. By default, the mode will be set to 'reflect' if
    the size is >= the data size, with an emitted warning.

    Furthermore, a median filter is *not* an identity operation, even on monotonic
    functions, for an even-sized kernel (in this case it's the average of the two
    central values).

    Also, even for an odd-sized kernel, if using flags, some of the windows will contain
    an odd number of useable data, in which case the data surrounding the flag will not
    be identical to the input.

    Finally, flags near the edges can have strange behaviour, depending on the mode.

    Notes
    -----
    This detrending is very good for data with large RFI compared to the noise, but also
    reasonably large noise compared to the spectrum steepness. If the noise is small
    compared to the steepness of the spectrum, individual windows can become *almost always*
    monotonic, in which case the randomly non-monotonic bins "stick out" and get wrongly
    flagged. This can be helped three ways:
    1) Use a smaller bin width. This helps by reducing the probability that a bin will
       be randomly non-monotonic. However it also loses signal-to-noise on the RFI.
    2) Pre-fit a smooth model that "flattens" the spectrum. This helps by reducing the
       probability that bins will be monotonic (higher noise level wrt steepness). It
       has the disadvantage that fitted models can be wrong when there's RFI there.
    3) Follow the medfilt with a meanfilt: if the medfilt is able to flag most/all of
       the RFI, then a following meanfilt will tend to "unfilter" the wrongly flagged
       parts.

        ``(NTIMES, NFREQS)`` defining the measured raw spectrum.
        If 2D, a 2D filter in freq*time will be applied by default. One can perform

        `kt=0`.
    threshold : float, optional
        Number of effective sigma at which to clip RFI.
    flags : array-like, optional
        Boolean array of pre-existing flagged data to ignore in the filtering.
    kt, kf : tuple of int/None
        The half-size of the kernel to convolve (eg. kernel size over frequency
        will be ``2*kt+1``).

        applying the detrending for each subarray along that axis. Value of None will
        effectively (but slowly) perform a median along the entire axis before running

    inplace : bool, optional
        If True, and flags are given, update the flags in-place instead of creating a
        new array.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations to perform. Each iteration uses the flags of the
        previous iteration to achieve a more robust estimate of the flags. Multiple
        iterations are more useful if ``poly_order > 0``.
    poly_order : int, optional
        If greater than 0, fits a polynomial to the spectrum before performing
        the median filter. Only allowed if spectrum is 1D. This is useful for getting
        the number of false positives down. If max_iter>1, the polynomial will be refit
        on each iteration (using new flags).
    accumulate : bool,optional
        If True, on each iteration, accumulate flags. Otherwise, use only flags from the
        previous iteration and then forget about them. Recommended to be False.
    use_meanfilt : bool, optional
        Whether to apply a mean filter *after* the median filter. The median filter is
        good at getting RFI, but can also pick up non-RFI if the spectrum is steep
        compared to the noise. The mean filter is better at only getting RFI if the RFI
        has already been flagged.

    Returns
    -------
    flags : array-like
        Boolean array of the same shape as ``spectrum`` indicated which channels/times
        have flagged RFI.

    Notes
    -----
    The default combination of using a median filter followed by a mean filter works
    quite well. The median filter works quite well at picking up large RFI (wrt to the
    noise level), but can also create false positives if the noise level is small wrt
    the steepness of the slope. Following by a flagged mean filter tends to remove these
    false positives (as it doesn't get pinned to zero when the function is monotonic).

    It is unclear whether performing an iterative filtering is very useful unless using
    a polynomial subtraction. With polynomial subtraction, one should likely use at least
    a few iterations, without accumulation, so that the polynomial is not skewed by the
    as-yet-unflagged RFI.

    Choice of kernel size can be important. The wider the kernel, the more "signal-to-noise"
    one will get on the RFI. Also, if there is a bunch of RFI all clumped together, it will
    definitely be missed by a kernel window of order double the size of the clump or less.
    By increasing the kernel size, these clumps are picked up, but edge-effects become
    more prevalent in this case. One option here would be to iterate over kernel sizes
    (getting smaller), such that very large blobs are first flagged out, then progressively
    finer detail is added. Use ``xrfi_iterative_medfilt`` for that.

    Flag RFI by subtracting a smooth polynomial and iteratively removing outliers.

    On each iteration, a polynomial is fit to the unflagged data, and a lower-order
    polynomial is fit to the absolute residuals of the data with the model polynomial.
    Bins with absolute residuals greater than `n_abs_resid_threshold` are flagged,
    and the process is repeated until no new flags are found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spectrum : array-like
        A 1D or 2D array, where the last axis corresponds to frequency. The data
        measured at those frequencies.
    flags : array-like, optional
        The flags associated with the data (same shape as `spectrum`).
    f_ratio : float, optional
        The ratio of the max to min frequency to be fit. Only required if ``f_log``
        is True.
    f_log : bool, optional
        Whether to fit the signal with log-spaced frequency values.
    t_log : bool, optional
        Whether to fit the signal with log temperature.
    n_signal : int, optional
        The number of polynomial terms to use to fit the signal.
    n_resid : int, optional
        The number of polynomial terms to use to fit the residuals.
    threshold : float, optional
        The factor by which the absolute residual model is multiplied to determine
        outliers.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations to perform.
    accumulate : bool, optional
        Whether to accumulate flags on each iteration.
    increase_order : bool, optional
        Whether to increase the order of the polynomial on each iteration.
    decrement_threshold : float, optional
        An amount to decrement the threshold by every iteration. Threshold will never
        go below ``min_threshold``.
    min_threshold : float, optional
        The minimum threshold to decrement to.

    Returns
    -------
    flags : array-like
        Boolean array of the same shape as ``spectrum`` indicated which channels/times
        have flagged RFI.
